"Leg room and a seat that fits a himan being??? I fucks wit #Jetblue "
I normally am all about flying #JetBlue but today's travel plans are completely sideways. Got on a plane to turn tight back around to my backyard smh #Jetblueairline
Reason 100000 I love working for this amazing company #jetblue ... our catering truck slogans are  #Yassss
#jetblue yhack2019 test
#JetBlue thanks for screwing my weekend plans with canceling all flights out of JFK for weather!! Forecast tomorrow is 60 & sunny! But somehow flights out of LGA five miles away from JFK are all on time! Makes no sense! Horrible customer service!!
"Made a good move today with #JetBlue also. They beat earnings expectations, although seat mile will slow, fuel cost are also going down. Up 7.31% today "
"One flew over the cuckoo's nest 
Some flew blue (JetBlue)
Some South West.
#JetBlue  Here's some unrefined marketing for you; from the children's rhyme and how the great book; One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest begins."
"@Delta, @AmericanAir any chance you can hook up a once loyal @JetBlue customer and get me in Vegas on time for my next meeting?  Already missed my first one...  #ComeStealMeAway #JetBlue #jetbluedelays"
"#jetblue Stuck for 5 hours delay at SFO. Flight 516. Jet blue is saying it is due to weather and JFK runaway construction. However, other airlines (Delta, Alaska, American) departed SFO on time. So does the weather only affect jet blue? Something is very fishy going on here."
Hearing from workers that if this plane is not fixed there is no back up plan. Can you please come up with one??? @JetBlue #jetblue #JetBlueFlashFares
Paid for two seats on this flight for comfort because you know how thin people are when we big people even appear like we might sit in part of their space. This woman next to me has her magazines and purse in MY seat!!! Um you got half this money?! #jetblue
"#JetBlue reduces its #Cuba service.

Awful experience at BNA #jetblue.  One ticket representative who disappeared and came back. Then we got pushed aside only to have people cut in front of us. Then he couldn’t print out baggage tickets. Next time I am taking #Delta
