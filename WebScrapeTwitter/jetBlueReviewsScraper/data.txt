#jetblue automated test run. YHacks 2019. Customer satisfaction bot v4 trial 4.
@TCIGO what in GODS name is going on?  Your airport is ON STRIKE?  So much for getting the full day in - great for tourism  #jetblue #jfk #pls
Reason 100000 I love working for this amazing company #jetblue ... our catering truck slogans are  #Yassss
I normally am all about flying #JetBlue but today's travel plans are completely sideways. Got on a plane to turn tight back around to my backyard smh #Jetblueairline
"@Delta, @AmericanAir any chance you can hook up a once loyal @JetBlue customer and get me in Vegas on time for my next meeting?  Already missed my first one...  #ComeStealMeAway #JetBlue #jetbluedelays"

"Made a good move today with #JetBlue also. They beat earnings expectations, although seat mile will slow, fuel cost are also going down. Up 7.31% today "
"So far the comp plan for turning the the plane, deboarding and having us wait in the airport until they get a different plan is free snacks and beverages... The same beverages we had access to when were actually on our way.  #JetBlue #Jetblueairlines #fuelproblem"
#JetBlue thanks for screwing my weekend plans with canceling all flights out of JFK for weather!! Forecast tomorrow is 60 & sunny! But somehow flights out of LGA five miles away from JFK are all on time! Makes no sense! Horrible customer service!!
"One flew over the cuckoo's nest 
Some flew blue (JetBlue)
Some South West.
#JetBlue  Here's some unrefined marketing for you; from the children's rhyme and how the great book; One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest begins."
#JetBlue is trippin with all these delays!
"#jetblue Stuck for 5 hours delay at SFO. Flight 516. Jet blue is saying it is due to weather and JFK runaway construction. However, other airlines (Delta, Alaska, American) departed SFO on time. So does the weather only affect jet blue? Something is very fishy going on here."
Paid for two seats on this flight for comfort because you know how thin people are when we big people even appear like we might sit in part of their space. This woman next to me has her magazines and purse in MY seat!!! Um you got half this money?! #jetblue
Awful experience at BNA #jetblue.  One ticket representative who disappeared and came back. Then we got pushed aside only to have people cut in front of us. Then he couldn’t print out baggage tickets. Next time I am taking #Delta
"And they actually reply to their social media accounts .... list keeps on going.  I thought all airlines had the dollar as what they served.  Seems #jetblue actually puts the customer first ! Wow "
Hearing from workers that if this plane is not fixed there is no back up plan. Can you please come up with one??? @JetBlue #jetblue #JetBlueFlashFares
